[Credentials]

# Google OAuth2 credentials (for "gs://" URIs):
# The following OAuth2 token is authorized for scope(s):
#     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control
gs_oauth2_refresh_token = 1/MWMK_k_NapIiYb7vDxxZ5VlBYVgRNUh8X_BNuRxISnk

# To add google credentials ("gs://" URIs), edit and uncomment the
# following two lines:
#gs_access_key_id = <your google access key ID>
#gs_secret_access_key = <your google secret access key>
# The ability to specify an alternate storage host is primarily for cloud
# storage service developers.
#gs_host = <alternate storage host address>

# To add aws credentials ("s3://" URIs), edit and uncomment the
# following two lines:
#aws_access_key_id = <your aws access key ID>
#aws_secret_access_key = <your aws secret access key>
# The ability to specify an alternate storage host is primarily for cloud
# storage service developers.
#s3_host = <alternate storage host address>


[Boto]

# To use a proxy, edit and uncomment the proxy and proxy_port lines. If you
# need a user/password with this proxy, edit and uncomment those lines as well.
#proxy = <proxy host>
#proxy_port = <proxy port>
#proxy_user = <your proxy user name>
#proxy_pass = <your proxy password>

# The following two options control the use of a secure transport for requests
# to S3 and Google Storage. It is highly recommended to set both options to
# True in production environments, especially when using OAuth2 bearer token
# authentication with Google Storage.

# Set 'is_secure' to False to cause boto to connect using HTTP instead of the
# default HTTPS. This is useful if you want to capture/analyze traffic
# (e.g., with tcpdump). This option should always be set to True in production
# environments.
#is_secure = False

# Set 'https_validate_certificates' to False to disable server certificate
# checking. This is useful if you want to capture/analyze traffic using an
# intercepting proxy. This option should always be set to True in production
# environments.
# In gsutil, the default for this option is True. *However*, the default for
# this option in the boto library itself is currently 'False'; it is therefore
# recommended to always set this option explicitly to True in configuration
# files.
https_validate_certificates = True

# 'debug' controls the level of debug messages printed: 0 for none, 1
# for basic boto debug, 2 for all boto debug plus HTTP requests/responses.
# Note: 'gsutil -d' sets debug to 2 for that one command run.
#debug = <0, 1, or 2>

# 'num_retries' controls the number of retry attempts made when errors occur.
# The default is 5. Note: don't set this value to 0, as it will cause boto to
# fail when reusing HTTP connections.
#num_retries = <integer value>


[GSUtil]

# 'resumable_threshold' specifies the smallest file size [bytes] for which
# resumable Google Storage transfers are attempted. The default is 1048576
# (1MB).
#resumable_threshold = 1048576

# 'resumable_tracker_dir' specifies the base location where resumable
# transfer tracker files are saved. By default they're in ~/.gsutil
#resumable_tracker_dir = <file path>

# 'parallel_thread_count' specifies the number of threads to use when executing
# operations in parallel. Currently only used for multithreaded copy (cp -m).
#parallel_thread_count = 24

# 'default_api_version' specifies the default Google Storage API version to
# use use. If not set below gsutil defaults to API version 1.
default_api_version = 2

# 'default_project_id' specifies the default Google Storage project ID to use
# with the 'mb' and 'ls' commands. If defined it overrides the default value
# you set in the API Console. Either of these defaults can be overridden
# by specifying the -p option to the 'mb' and 'ls' commands.
default_project_id = 673945876730



[OAuth2]
# This section specifies options used with OAuth2 authentication.

# 'token_cache' specifies how the OAuth2 client should cache access tokens.
# Valid values are:
#  'in_memory': an in-memory cache is used. This is only useful if the boto
#      client instance (and with it the OAuth2 plugin instance) persists
#      across multiple requests.
#  'file_system' : access tokens will be cached in the file system, in files
#      whose names include a key derived from the refresh token the access token
#      based on.
# The default is 'file_system'.
#token_cache = file_system
#token_cache = in_memory

# 'token_cache_path_pattern' specifies a path pattern for token cache files.
# This option is only relevant if token_cache = file_system.
# The value of this option should be a path, with place-holders '%(key)s' (which
# will be replaced with a key derived from the refresh token the cached access
# token was based on), and (optionally), %(uid)s (which will be replaced with
# the UID of the current user, if available via os.getuid()).
# Note that the config parser itself interpolates '%' placeholders, and hence
# the above placeholders need to be escaped as '%%(key)s'.
# The default value of this option is
#  token_cache_path_pattern = <tmpdir>/oauth2client-tokencache.%%(uid)s.%%(key)s
# where <tmpdir> is the system-dependent default temp directory.

# The following options specify the OAuth2 client identity and secret that is
# used when requesting and using OAuth2 tokens. If not specified, a default
# OAuth2 client for the gsutil tool is used; for uses of the boto library (with
# OAuth2 authentication plugin) in other client software, it is recommended to
# use a tool/client-specific OAuth2 client. For more information on OAuth2, see
# http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html
#client_id = <OAuth2 client id>
#client_secret = <OAuth2 client secret>

# The following options specify the label and endpoint URIs for the OAUth2
# authorization provider being used. Primarily useful for tool developers.
#provider_label = Google
#provider_authorization_uri = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
#provider_token_uri = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
